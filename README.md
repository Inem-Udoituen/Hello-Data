# Recommendations:
In the next month, Management should channel acquisition campaign to learners in the Junior level to get more learners in that level and strike a balance.

Management should channel retention campaign to learners in the Senior level as well, to retain their current learners and acquire more learners in this level.

More tutors should be employed to increase the rate of classes completed.

Management should make incentives to reward tutors who perform best in the month. This will motivate the tutors to take up more sessions and be more efficient.
